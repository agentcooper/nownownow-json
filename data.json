We tried to pay all of our debts, but ended up being completely wiped out (short and long-term savings, life insurance/disability policy, etc.), ultimately we were forced into bankruptcy. Our story has been replicated across the country.",

Picking up one of the many books on my to-read list after another \"day of reading\" was the last thing I wanted to. \r\n\r\nThat was until I finally picked up a book I wanted to read solely for the pleasure of reading it. Reading this book didn't have the premise of me learning something new; It wouldn't help me get things done, think smarter, or teach me about the history of the world and it certainly wasn't mandatory reading because I had a paper to submit. \r\n\r\nIt was just reading because that's what I wanted to do. That book helped me re-discover that I love reading and I have since then lost track of how many books I have read. So if you are in a situation similar to mine, and reading mostly fills you with dread, then I recommend that you pick up something you have always wanted to read and then just get started. If it still feels like a chore, then stop, put it down and find something else to read. \r\n\r\n* In my case I read \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" by Arthur Conan Doyle. Its free from Project Gutenberg and many other places.",
